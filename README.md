Main stages for scaffolding:
1. Genomic DNA extraction and library preparation
2. Illumina sequencing
3. Quality control for sequencing with FASTQC
4. Quality control for library preparation with Phase Genomic pipeline
5. Alignment and generating Hi-C contact map
6. Automatic scaffolding
7. Manually reviewing and correcting assembly
